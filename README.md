# MusicTrie
This is a example of a music library such as spotify
The program reads in a file of songs, artists, genres and a rating 
it then adds all those songs as nodes to a trie. From that database you can then add songs into playlists and queues.
I used a trie specifically so i could get a auto update search. So if i type in a letter when i search fr a song the top 5 songs based 
on the rating of the song starting with the letter are shown. Then you can put in a second letter and the list iwll narrow and so on until
you get the desired song.
